# Step 2: Set Your OpenAI API Key
To ask the AI questions, this notebook needs to connect to OpenAI using an API key. An API key is like a password that gives you access.

**Goal:** Allow the notebook to communicate with OpenAI.
**Action:**
1.  Get your API key from OpenAI's website: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2.  In the file browser, copy the `.env.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.
3.  Paste your key into the `.env` file and save it.
4.  Run this cell.

*Note: Running searches uses the OpenAI API, which may have associated costs. You can set usage limits in your OpenAI account dashboard.*
