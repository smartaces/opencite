# Analysis Step 4: Create a Report Grouped by Your Prompts
This report flips the analysis around. Instead of focusing on the citations, it organizes the results based on the questions you asked. It lets you easily review all the different sources that were returned for each prompt you entered.

### Using the Filters
Use the filters to select a specific prompt you want to investigate, or filter by a keyword to see a group of related prompts.

### Report Metrics Guide
